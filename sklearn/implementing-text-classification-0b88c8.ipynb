    "One of the widely used natural language processing task in different business problems is “Text Classification”. The goal of text classification is to automatically classify the text documents into one or more defined categories. Some examples of text classification are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understanding audience sentiment from social media,\n",
    "- Detection of spam and non-spam emails,\n",
    "- Auto tagging of customer queries, and\n",
    "- Categorization of news articles into defined topics."

    "\n",
    "1. Dataset Preparation: The first step is the Dataset Preparation step which includes the process of loading a dataset and performing basic pre-processing. The dataset is then splitted into train and validation sets.\n",
    "2. Feature Engineering: The next step is the Feature Engineering in which the raw dataset is transformed into flat features which can be used in a machine learning model. This step also includes the process of creating new features from the existing data.\n",
    "3. Model Training: The final step is the Model Building step in which a machine learning model is trained on a labelled dataset.\n",

I have used Latent Dirichlet Allocation for generating Topic Modelling Features. LDA is an iterative model which starts from a fixed number of topics. Each topic is represented as a distribution over words, and each document is then represented as a distribution over topics. Although the tokens themselves are meaningless, the probability distributions over words provided by the topics provide a sense of the different ideas contained in the documents.\n",

At the end, discussed about different approach to improve the performance of text classifiers."
